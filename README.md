# Book Watch

## **Description**

- Book Watch is a full MERN stack application where users can create an account, search for books using google API requests, and save books to easily remember hot titles!
- This application was written using JavaScript, HTML, CSS, ES6, React, Node, Express.js, MongoDB, GraphQL, Apollo, and deployed on Heroku
- The motivation behind Book Watch was the need to easily maintain a list of books users would like to read,  using a simple and intuitive user interface.
- While building this site, my intention was to increase my understanding of MongoDB, GraphQL, and React to handle a full MERN stack application.
